# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose of Project

### The purpose of this project is to provide travel and hotel suggestions to users based on their input of ideal weather temperature. Using Jupyter notebook and Google Maps API, create a heat map of ideal travel destinations with pop up markers. Further use of the Google Directions API will be used to create a travel itinerary, including a map with pop up markers.
